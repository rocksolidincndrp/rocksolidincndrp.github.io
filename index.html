            <p class="fadein">Rock Solid incorporated was founded in October of 2024 by Von Hendrix. The idea for the company started from his independent work for friends as a graphics designer and web developer. Eventually the decision was made to turn his hobby/passion into a fully fleshed business everyone could benefit from. Rock Solid Incorporated aims to work closely with all of its customers, enabling the designers and developers to create websites that encapsule the "aesthetic" that a client is aiming for.</p>
